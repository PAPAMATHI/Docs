# Docs

Docs is meant to be a place to share our knowledge together.
We are several IT professionals, students or enthusiasts to write notes or documentations on different subjects and keep them on our posts. So why not share them between us? This would allow us to build skills, discover solutions and teach each other.

If you want to write on Docs, it is possible! Contact me at : mathieujdscontact@gmail.com
